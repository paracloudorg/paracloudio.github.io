It's important to have a clear understanding of your infrastructure in order to
prevent waste. Our tools allow you to easily convert your existing cloud resources
into Infrastructure as Code. Simply run the tool, and you'll receive all your cloud
resources in code of Ansible playbooks or Terraform. With Infrastructure-as-Code
best practices, you'll be able to manage this code with ease. By running this code,
you can deploy the same infrastructure on any other region or project with just a
Copy&Paste of your cloud. Use these playbooks to organize your infrastructure and
optimize resources, and manage your cloud with GitOps.
