We offer a convenient solution for multi-cloud deployment. Our service generates
Terraform deployment scripts based on your specific configuration requirements.
Simply create a YAML file that describes your desired cloud services, using our
demo as an example, and then click "**Generate!**". You will receive deployment scripts
for both AWS and Azure cloud providers. This allows you to freely choose which cloud
provider you want to use and easily switch to another if a discount becomes available.
